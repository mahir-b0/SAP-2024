# SAP-2024

Welcome to my **SAP**, a mock cyber forensics investigation project designed to test and enhance skills in OSINT, cryptography, steganography, and web exploitation. This project takes participants on a journey to solve a murder mystery by piecing together clues and ultimately obtaining a confession from the killer.

## Project Overview

The investigation is structured across four interconnected repositories, each hosting specific challenges. Participants will navigate through these repositories, solving challenges to uncover critical clues.

### **Repositories**

1. **[Funnelweb](https://github.com/mahir-b0/funnelweb)**  
   Hosts introductory OSINT practice exercises. These exercises familiarize participants with the tools and techniques needed to tackle the main challenges. Funnelweb also contains the final cryptography challenge.

2. **[Icarus](https://github.com/mahir-b0/icarus)**  
   Contains OSINT challenges that involve investigating the social profiles of two fake victims. The clues gathered here provide insights into the killer's identity.

3. **[Basilisk](https://github.com/mahir-b0/basilisk)**  
   Focuses on steganography challenges. Successfully solving these challenges yields keys that unlock access to the next phase.

4. **[Pinocchio](https://github.com/mahir-b0/pinocchio)**  
   A web application hosting an SQL injection challenge. Solving this challenge reveals critical information that links back to Funnelweb, where the final cryptography challenge awaits.

## Project Flow

1. **Orientation (Funnelweb)**: Start by solving OSINT exercises to get familiar with the tools.
2. **Reconnaissance (Icarus)**: Investigate fake social profiles to gather clues about the killer.
3. **Unlocking Secrets (Basilisk)**: Solve steganography challenges to obtain keys.
4. **Data Breach (Pinnochio)**: Use SQL injection to extract crucial data.
5. **Final Countdown (Funnelweb)**: Crack the final cryptography hash to complete the investigation.

## Technologies and Skills

- **OSINT**: Open-source intelligence gathering and analysis.
- **Cryptography**: Hash cracking and secure communication.
- **Steganography**: Hidden data retrieval.
- **Web Exploitation**: SQL injection and other web application vulnerabilities.

## How to Get Started
